The line for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) is a for loop that iterates over each character in the str string. Here's what each part of the line does:

var i = 0: This initializes the loop variable i to 0. The loop variable keeps track of the index of the current character being processed.
i < str.length: This is the loop condition. It specifies that the loop should continue as long as the value of i is less than the length of the str string. The loop will stop executing when i becomes equal to or greater than str.length.
i++: This is the loop increment expression. It increments the value of i by 1 after each iteration of the loop.
So, in summary, the for loop iterates over the characters of the str string from the first character (index 0) to the last character (index str.length - 1). It allows you to perform some operation on each character of the string. In this case, it is used to decode each character of the ROT13 encoded string.
